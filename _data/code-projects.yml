  description: "Baby's first iOS app! **Super Countdown Tracker** began life as a Lambda School build week project, and I liked it so much I decided to polish it up and put it on the app store. It's a simple, lightweight app that does one thing very wellâ€”it tells you how much time is left until the events you feed it. It also features tags, notes, sorting, filtering, auto-archive, and a custom, automatic, adaptive light/dark theme. Find it [on the iOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/super-countdown-tracker/id1484864299?ls=1)!"

  description: "I made this very website you're now reading! This was a major redesign coming from Wordpress, which I'd opted to quit using because: a. I don't like PHP; b. Wordpress was starting to feel like overkill for my needs; c. I wanted to improve my programming skills; d. I wanted to save money. I'm hosting it on [NearlyFreeSpeech.net](https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net), which is *very* inexpensive (especially for simple, static websites like this one)."

  description: "**Lambdi Pet** is a prototype app built for a service for parents to motivate their children to eat healthily by mirroring their eating in feeding a cute digital pet avatar. This is a very basic app that I would have loved to have several weeks to build on to do some sound design and animation for the pet to make it even more motivating, but I'm quite proud of what I was able to accomplish in the short timeframe!"
