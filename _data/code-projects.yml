  description: "I worked as a contractor with Rekor for a few months, during which time I worked on various aspects of this app, refinining the UI, fixing memory leaks and other issues, adding additional networking logic, and more. I also worked on another app, writing the entire project from scratch using in-house frameworks, SwiftUI, [Composable Architecture](http://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture), and more."

  description: "This was a project for the [non-profit organization **Eco-Soap Bank**](http://ecosoapbank.org), which employees women local to developing areas around the world to distribute recycled soap and other products from hotels. This app is for hotel partners to track shipments and payments. It was made with a mix of UIKit and SwiftUI, utilizing the coordinator design pattern. We also notably opted to interface with GraphQL without using the usually-recommended Apollo framework, which actually worked out quite well."

  description: "My first \"real\" iOS app, **Super Countdown Tracker** began life as a Lambda School build week project, and I liked it so much I decided to polish it up and put it on the app store. It's a simple, lightweight app that does one thing very wellâ€”it tells you how much time is left until the events you feed it. It also features tags, notes, sorting, filtering, auto-archive, and a custom, automatic, adaptive light/dark theme. Find it [on the iOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/super-countdown-tracker/id1484864299?ls=1)!"

  description: "I made this very website you're now reading! This was a major redesign coming from Wordpress, which I'd opted to quit using because: a. I don't like PHP; b. Wordpress was starting to feel like overkill for my needs; c. I wanted to improve my programming skills; d. I wanted to save money. So, I rewrote the website using Jekyll, Markdown, Bootstrap, and of course the usuals (HTML, CSS, Javascript). I started out hosting it on [NearlyFreeSpeech.net](https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net), but have recently moved to Netlify."

  description: "**Lambdi Pet** is a prototype app built for a service for parents to motivate their children to eat healthily by mirroring their eating in feeding a cute digital pet avatar. This is a very basic app that I would have loved to have several weeks to build on to do some sound design and animation for the pet to make it even more motivating, but I'm quite proud of what I was able to accomplish in the short timeframe!"
