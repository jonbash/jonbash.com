  description: "I made this very website you're now reading! This was a major redesign coming from Wordpress, which I'd opted to quit using because: a. I don't like PHP; b. Wordpress was starting to feel like overkill for my needs; c. I wanted to improve my programming skills; d. I wanted to save money. I'm hosting it on NearlyFreeSpeech.net, which is *insanely*, especially for cheap for simple, static websites like this one."
