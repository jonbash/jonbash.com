  description: "This was my first Build Week project at Lambda School. It's a simple, lightweight does one thing very wellâ€”it tells you how much time is left until the dates you give it. It also sorts and filters your events, archives them, and holds notes related to them. Some related features will continue to be added. I'm so satisfied with how it came out, it will be coming to the App Store in the not-too-distant future!"

  description: "I made this very website you're now reading! This was a major redesign coming from Wordpress, which I'd opted to quit using because: a. I don't like PHP; b. Wordpress was starting to feel like overkill for my needs; c. I wanted to improve my programming skills; d. I wanted to save money. I'm hosting it on NearlyFreeSpeech.net, which is *insanely*, especially for cheap for simple, static websites like this one."
