  description: "Baby's first iOS app! **Super Countdown Tracker** began life as a Lambda School build week project, and I liked it so much I decided to polish it up and put it on the app store. It's a simple, lightweight app that does one thing very wellâ€”it tells you how much time is left until the events you feed it. It also features tags, notes, sorting, filtering, auto-archive, and a custom, automatic, adaptive light/dark theme. Find it [on the iOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/super-countdown-tracker/id1484864299?ls=1)!"

  description: "I made this very website you're now reading! This was a major redesign coming from Wordpress, which I'd opted to quit using because: a. I don't like PHP; b. Wordpress was starting to feel like overkill for my needs; c. I wanted to improve my programming skills; d. I wanted to save money. I'm hosting it on [NearlyFreeSpeech.net](https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net), which is *very* inexpensive (especially for simple, static websites like this one)."
