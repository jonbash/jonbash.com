  description: "This was a project for the [non-profit organization **Eco-Soap Bank**](http://ecosoapbank.org), which employees women local to developing areas around the world to distribute recycled soap and other products from hotels. This app is for hotel partners to track shipments and payments. It was made with a mix of UIKit and SwiftUI, utilizing the coordinator design pattern. We also notably opted to interface with GraphQL without using the usually-recommended Apollo framework, which actually worked out quite well."

  description: "My first \"real\" iOS app, **Super Countdown Tracker** began life as a Lambda School build week project, and I liked it so much I decided to polish it up and put it on the app store. It's a simple, lightweight app that does one thing very wellâ€”it tells you how much time is left until the events you feed it. It also features tags, notes, sorting, filtering, auto-archive, and a custom, automatic, adaptive light/dark theme. Find it [on the iOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/super-countdown-tracker/id1484864299?ls=1)!"

Wordpress was starting to feel like overkill for my needs; c. I wanted to improve my programming skills; d. I wanted to save money. I'm hosting it on [NearlyFreeSpeech.net](https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net), which is *very* inexpensive (especially for simple, static websites like this one)."

This is a very basic app that I would have loved to have several weeks to build on to do some sound design and animation for the pet to make it even more motivating, but I'm quite proud of what I was able to accomplish in the short timeframe!"
