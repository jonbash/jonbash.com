<p>Five years ago I looked back on what music had the most significant impact on me at various stages in 5-year intervals of my life, a la <a href="http://pitchfork.com/features/5-10-15-20/">Pitchfork’s interview series</a>. Good luck finding the previous post I made on the subject. Here’s an updated version.</p>

<h2 id="age-5-rumours-by-fleetwood-mac">Age 5: <em>Rumours</em> by Fleetwood Mac</h2>

<p>Most of the music I grew up on came from my dad; Rolling Stones, The Beatles, The Beach Boys, Steve Miller Band, The Allman Brothers, etc. Lots of late-60s and 70s rock. Fleetwood Mac is what I remember best and has continued to resonate with me the most. I may be looking back with tinted lenses a bit, but I think this album has most closely shaped and aligned with my current tastes.</p>

<p><strong>Favorite track: “The Chain”</strong></p>

<p>A year later my brother would get tapes of Green Day’s <em>Insomniac</em> and Weird Al’s <em>Bad Hair Day</em>. That trifecta of albums, along with the next one on this list, makes up large chunks of my musical personality.</p>

<h2 id="age-10-weezer-the-blue-album-by-weezer">Age 10: <em>Weezer (“The Blue Album”)</em> by Weezer</h2>

<p>Weezer was another band that my brother introduced me to. At a time when I started to become more aware of my social standing in school (or lack thereof), Weezer’s celebration of geekdom pulled me in. This was also the year I started learning guitar, and the indie-pop-meets-punk-aesthetic-with-hints-of-metal sound heavily shaped my guitar playing and songwriting for years to come. Unfortunately the kinda-misogynist-at-times lyrics (“I want a girl who will laugh for no one else”?!) also partially shaped my unfortunate view of relationships for years to come, and wouldn’t be undone (ha) until college.</p>

<p>This last February some friends and I got together and played some Weezer covers for a Valentine’s Day cover show. It was a load of fun.</p>

<p><strong>Favorite track: “Say it Ain’t So”</strong></p>

<h2 id="age-15-clarity-by-jimmy-eat-world">Age 15: <em>Clarity</em> by Jimmy Eat World</h2>

<p>I got this album for Christmas in 2004 during a really weird and angsty time my first year of high school. Honestly this schmaltzy album probably didn’t help much, but the intricate, layered arrangements on a lot of the songs (“For Me This is Heaven,” “Goodbye Sky Harbor”) stuck with me. Looking at it now I can see just how silly the lyrics are, but it was the perfect soundtrack to a period that seemed like a way bigger deal at the time.</p>

<p><strong>Favorite track: “For Me This is Heaven”</strong></p>

<h2 id="age-20-the-rite-of-spring-by-igor-stravinsky">Age 20: <em>The Rite of Spring</em> by Igor Stravinsky</h2>

<p>When I got to college I took a class called “The Art of Listening to Music” and was re-introduced to a piece I had forgotten from the several times I watched <em>Fantasia</em> and listened to it as a terrified child: Stravinsky’s <em>Le Sacre du Printemps</em>. It’s barbaric, violent, beautiful, and changed the world when it came out, and almost 100 years later it changed my world and set me down <em>the dark path of contemporary classical music</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Favorite section: “Ritual of the Ancestors”</strong></p>

<h2 id="age-25-fez-by-disasterpeace">Age 25: <em>Fez</em> by Disasterpeace</h2>

<p><em>Fez</em> is a game that is without a doubt as much about the sound as it is the visuals, and the sound-world that Rich Vreeland has crafted for this non-violent explorative platformer is always such a treat to visit. Its aesthetic is unique and consistent without becoming grating (something that Vreeland has become quite adept at it, proving himself again with the superb <em>Monsters Ate My Birthday Cake</em>), evocative, and emotionally resonant while remaining clearly synthesized, yet somehow organic.</p>

<p><strong>Favorite track: “Sync/Glitch”</strong> (yes, technically two tracks, but they sync (ha) up so nicely on the soundtrack album)</p>
