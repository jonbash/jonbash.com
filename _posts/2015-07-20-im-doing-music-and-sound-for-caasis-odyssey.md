<p>As of a couple of weeks ago, I’m officially onboard designing sound and writing music for the upcoming game <a href="http://www.indiedb.com/games/caasis-odyssey">Caasis Odyssey</a>! It’s a pleasure to be working on a game that’s already coming along so nicely, as you can see by the GIFs below.</p>

<p>It’s a top-down dungeon-crawler action-rpg with physics-based and roguelike-like systems. You can read the whole lovely shebang about it and see more pics and gameplay vids <a href="http://www.indiedb.com/games/caasis-odyssey">here on its indieDB page</a>. You can also follow development <a href="https://www.facebook.com/caasisodyssey">here at our Facebook page</a>.</p>

<p>So far I’ve made rough drafts of menu music and sounds for shooting, doors, chests, bones, and keys, and I’ve got a lot of work yet to come. My past sound design has all been in game jams, so it’s exciting to do something on a larger scale at last!</p>
