<p>This is my new blog! Wordpress wasn’t great at integrating with my new website layout without paying a ton of money, so I decided to hack something together myself using Github, Jekyll, Disqus, and a handful of other stuff that made for a rather frustrating couple of days.</p>

<p>Anyways, you can look forward to me posting news, music, and other stuff here.</p>

<p>For the old blog, you can still go to <a href="http://jonbash.wordpress.com">the old Wordpress page</a> and find all the old posts there. I thought about going through the process of transferring them over, but I think this is about enough for now, haha… maybe someday…</p>
