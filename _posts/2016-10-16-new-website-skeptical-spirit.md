In an effort to make my busy life even busier, I've started a new website calledÂ <a href="http://skeptical-spirit.net"><em>Skeptical Spirit</em></a>, where I'll be talking about stuff having to do with skepticism, spirituality, personal development, and basically anything tangentially related to those topics. I'll start reserving this website for stuff more related to music and games.
