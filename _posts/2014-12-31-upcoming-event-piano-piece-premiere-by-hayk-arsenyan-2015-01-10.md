<p>On Saturday, January 10th, Hayk Arsenyan will be premiering my piece “A Short, Lonely Dance” as part of the Fifteen-Minutes-of-Fame series. Fifteen one-minute pieces were chosen for this performance, and mine was among them. Although I cannot make it to the even (I so wish I could!), I heartily encourage anyone in the area to attend, as Hayk Arsenyan is an extremely accomplished pianist and the performances of all the brand new works will no doubt be riveting.</p>
