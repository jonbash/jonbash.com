Let's have some real talk about Facebook, Twitter, etc. I can't help but feel like I may come off self-righteous, moralizing, or otherwise obnoxious. It's not my intention, of course. Sometimes arranging words like this seems to help me think through stuff.

I've long been a bit disillusioned with social mediaâ€”the at first seemingly innocuous socializing with a strange mix of good friends, old lost friends, one-time acquaintances, and rando strangers on the servers of some corporation who's listening to these interactions, using them to shove the products of the highest bidders in our faces, manipulating the arrangement of conversations to keep us hooked, enticing with pretty buttons and bright colored notifications and endless new content and taking advantage of our FOMO and etc etc etc. It's only gotten more obvious as more news stories leak about the abuse of privacy going on. We all know this, and sometimes we announce dramatic intentions to leave only to crawl back when we realize the personal power that we've given to this impersonal machine (I have done this, er, more than once I think).

I've been reaching a breaking point with it lately. It's becoming harder to justify keeping it around. The main thing holding me back is, of course, the genuine & wholesome use I get out of it. I have a tendency towards social anxiety, and this platform has given me a means of making and maintaining connections I almost certainly would not otherwise have. But it's also become a crutch and maybe even made this negative tendency stronger, causing an atrophy of my social skills in some ways.

Still, it's almost embarrassing how hard it feels to get rid of my involvement with centralized/privatized social media. If I were to delete my presence here, I'd probably permanently lose touch with some folks, and that'd bum me out a bit. I'd probably miss out on gigs and opportunities, too. How would we even replace it at this point? The blogosphere of yore doesn't quite work as well for the same purposes.

But when I get really honest with myself, I can see that the drawbacks are starting to outweigh the costs, for me at least. Maybe it's okay that I won't keep in touch with everyone, that I'd have a bit more solitude, that fewer opportunities would come my way. Maybe it'd all be just fine.

I think I'd like to find out.

So... if you want to keep in touch with me, my email is jonbashmusic@gmail.com and my website is jonbash.com (I have a newsletter I don't send out often enough if you just want to know what I'm up to). I'd love to get a friendly, random hello email at any point from anyone (I don't know if I've ever gotten one of those...). I think I have the info of folks I really want to keep up with, but feel free to give me your contact info if it's recently changed or something.
