### <small>a short overview of how I'm spending my time</small>

- Preparing to [transition to a career in **software development**]({{ "/blog/career-change/" | absolute_url }})
- In the midst of writing *two* pieces for wind ensemble!
- Playing with **[LOVE2D](https://love2d.org){:target="_blank"}**, building my first game as a developer/designer (in addition to sound & music)
- Meditating lots
- Co-organizing the annual **[Game Audio Bash](http://eepurl.com/cAOEzH){:target="_blank"}** in Bellingham, WA every summer
