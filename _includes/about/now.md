### <small>a short overview of how I'm currently spending my time</small>

- Enjoying the heck out of training in iOS Development at [Lambda School](https://lambdaschool.com){:target="_blank"}. I'm currently in my second week of Objective-C; not nearly as bad as I anticipated!
- Building various frameworks and apps and such.
- Starting the process of applying for software development jobs!
- Playing through *Bloodborne* again with a friend after having just finished *Dark Souls* for the first time. After this I'll be going on to *Sekiro*.
- Sitting down at the piano or drumset and just playing, every now and then.
