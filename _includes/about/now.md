### <small>a short overview of how I'm currently spending my time</small>

- Studying iOS Development at [Lambda School](https://lambdaschool.com){:target="_blank"} to [transition to a career in programming](/blog/career-change/). This has been taking up the vast majority of my time and energy lately, but I'm enjoying the heck out of it!
- Occasionally playing around with [Unity](https://unity.com){:target="_blank"} after having spent the summer playing with [LOVE2D](https://love2d.org){:target="_blank"}.
- Playing *Dark Souls* for the first time (I'm slow with these things...).
- Sitting down at the piano and just playing, every now and then.
