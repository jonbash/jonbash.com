## Now

### <small>a short overview of how I'm currently spending my time</small>

- Studying at [Lambda School](https://lambdaschool.com){:target="_blank"} to [transition to a career in software (specifically iOS/macOS/etc) development](/blog/career-change/).
- Once again playing around with [Unity](https://unity.com){:target="_blank"} after spending the summer playing with [LOVE2D](https://love2d.org){:target="_blank"}. Unity is... a breath of fresh air, in terms of usability.
- Meditating ~~lots~~ less, but still as much as I can. (Beware of asking me about meditation; I get really excited about it. It's helped me a *lot*.)
- Co-organizing the ~~semi-~~annual **[Game Audio Bash](http://eepurl.com/cAOEzH){:target="_blank"}** in Bellingham, WA every summer ~~and winter~~. (Demand for the event seems to have declined and I don't have the time/energy/motivation to do it twice a year, so we're pushing it down to once a year.)
