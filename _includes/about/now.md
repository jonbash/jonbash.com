### <small>a short overview of how I'm spending my time</small>

- **Teaching music classes** at Western Washington University
- Playing with **[LOVE2D](https://love2d.org)**, building my first game as a developer/designer (in addition to sound & music)
- Basking in the joy of having recently released a **[split EP](https://friendsofsatan.bandcamp.com/releases)** with my friend [Megan Carnes](https://www.megancarnesmusic.com)
- Editing scores and parts for my friend and mentor [Roger Briggs](rogerbriggs.com){:target="_blank"}
- Not writing enough music, but dabbling on a couple of projects that are currently in their very early stages
- Co-organizing the semiannual **[Game Audio Bash](http://eepurl.com/cAOEzH){:target="_blank"}** in Bellingham, WA every January and July
- Various other microprojects here and there, along with some to-be-announced things
- [Meditating lots](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25942786-the-mind-illuminated){:target="_blank"}
- [Exercising lots](https://www.fitnessblender.com){:target="_blank"}
- Trying (with mixed success) to [stay focused on less rather than more](https://sivers.org/subtract){:target="_blank"}
