## Now
{: .display-4}
### <small>a short overview of how I'm currently spending my time</small>

- Studying at [Lambda School](https://lambdaschool.com){:target="_blank"} to [transition to a career in **software (specifically iOS/macOS/etc) development**]({{ "/blog/career-change/" | absolute_url }})
- After spending the summer playing with [LOVE2D](https://love2d.org){:target="_blank"}, I'm now coming back to [Unity](https://unity.com){:target="_blank"} and getting to know that again. It is... much easier to use, especially as a relative beginner like myself.
- Meditating lots.
- Co-organizing the annual **[Game Audio Bash](http://eepurl.com/cAOEzH){:target="_blank"}** in Bellingham, WA every summer.
