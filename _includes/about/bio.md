I've been programming in some format for nearly a decade. In 2019, after many years of programming using various languages as a hobbyist, I began formal training for Software Development (iOS emphasis) at Lambda School. I have programmed games, websites, and apps using Swift/Xcode, HTML/CSS/Javascript (+ Bootstrap, Jekyll, & Markdown), Unity & C#, Lua, LOVE2D, PICO-8, and Max/MSP.

As a musician, Iâ€™ve been composing, arranging, and performing an eclectic variety of polystylistic music for nearly two decades. I studied music composition, electroacoustic sound art, and music theory at Western Washington University under Roger Briggs, Bruce Hamilton, and Lesley Sommer, graduating magna cum laude in March 2013 with a BMus degree in Composition and in June 2015 with MMus degree in Composition. I have written music for games, dance repertoire, short & feature-length films, and for performers and ensembles such as the WWU Wind Symphony, the Equus Sax Quartet, the Bellingham Chamber Music Society, flautist Rachel Hacker, and percussionist Doug Perry. My music has been featured in films played at festivals across the US, most prominently in the cult monster film *Hunting Grounds* (*Valley of the Sasquatch* outside the US).

I currently live with my middle-school-teaching, clarinet-playing wife and <a href="#cougarModal" data-toggle="modal">our cat Cougar</a> in Bellingham, WA.
