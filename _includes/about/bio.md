Since beginning my career, I’ve been composing, arranging, and performing an eclectic variety of polystylistic music. I have written music for games, dance repertoire, short & feature-length films, and for performers and ensembles such as the WWU Wind Symphony, the Equus Sax Quartet, the Bellingham Chamber Music Society, flautist Rachel Hacker, and percussionist Doug Perry. My music has been featured in films played at festivals across the US, most prominently in the cult monster film *Hunting Grounds* (*Valley of the Sasquatch* outside the US). I’ve presented at events both local and internationally, such as at Bellingham's semiannual Game Audio Bash (which I co-founded and co-organize (...it is named after me, but I did not name it)) as well as at the international Ludomusicology Conference in Chichester, UK.

I studied music composition, electroacoustic sound art, and music theory at Western Washington University under Roger Briggs, Bruce Hamilton, and Lesley Sommer, graduating magna cum laude in March 2013 with a BMus degree in Composition and in June 2015 with MMus degree in Composition. I currently live with my middle-school-teaching, clarinet-playing wife and <a href="#cougarModal" data-toggle="modal">our cat</a> in Bellingham, WA.
