I've been programming in some format for nearly a decade. I have programmed apps, games, and websites using Swift/Xcode/Objective-C, HTML/CSS/Javascript (+ Bootstrap, Jekyll, & Markdown), Unity & C#, Godot, Lua, LOVE2D, and Max/MSP. At age 29, after many years of programming using various languages as a hobbyist, I began formal training for Software Development (iOS emphasis) at Lambda School. Though it's a fairly recent shift, I've quickly developed a reputation for being a sharp & detailed programmer and a voracious learner, able to adapt swiftly (no pun intended) to new technologies and architectures.

As a musician, Iâ€™ve been composing, arranging, and performing an eclectic variety of polystylistic music for nearly two decades. I studied music composition, electroacoustic sound art, and music theory at Western Washington University under Roger Briggs, Bruce Hamilton, and Lesley Sommer, graduating magna cum laude in March 2013 with a BMus degree in Composition and in June 2015 with MMus degree in Composition. I have written music for games, short & feature-length films, dance, and performers & ensembles such as the WWU Wind Symphony, the Equus Sax Quartet, the Bellingham Chamber Music Society, flautist Rachel Hacker, and percussionist Doug Perry. My music has been featured in films played at festivals across the US, most prominently in the cult monster film *Hunting Grounds* (*Valley of the Sasquatch* outside the US).

I currently live with my middle-school-teaching, clarinet-playing wife and <a href="#cougarModal" data-toggle="modal">our cat Cougar</a> in Bellingham, WA.
