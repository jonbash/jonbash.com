## Bio

Since beginning my career, I’ve been composing, arranging, and performing an eclectic variety of polystylistic music, including for games, films, the concert hall, and for fun. Game music and sound art has especially been a longtime passion of mine, and making it my career has been an exciting and rewarding ride.

My music has been featured in several games, demos, and other interactive projects, and has been performed by WWU Wind Symphony, the Equus Sax Quartet, the Bellingham Chamber Music Society, Rachel Hacker, Madeline Slettedahl, and many others. I’ve also had music featured in film festivals across the US, most prominently in the cult monster film Hunting Grounds (formerly Valley of the Sasquatch). I’ve presented at events both abroad and internationally, at the semiannual Game Audio Bash I co-founded and co-organize as well as at the international Ludomusicology Conference in Chichester, UK.

I studied music composition at Western Washington University under Roger Briggs and Bruce Hamilton, graduating magna cum laude in both March 2013 with a Bachelor of Music in Composition and in June 2015 with Master of Music in Composition. I currently lives with my middle-school-teaching wife and our cat in Bellingham, WA, where I continues to actively compose, teach, and perform.
