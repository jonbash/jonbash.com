## About Jon

<div class="col-lg-9" markdown="1">
Since beginning my career, I’ve been composing, arranging, and performing an eclectic variety of polystylistic music. My music has been featured in games, dance repertoire, short & feature-length films, and has been performed by such groups as the WWU Wind Symphony, the Equus Sax Quartet, the Bellingham Chamber Music Society and many others. I’ve also had music featured in film festivals across the US, most prominently in the cult monster film *Hunting Grounds* (*Valley of the Sasquatch* outside the US). I’ve presented at events both local and internationally, such as at Bellingham's semiannual Game Audio Bash (which I co-founded and co-organize (...it is named after me, but I did not name it)) as well as at the international Ludomusicology Conference in Chichester, UK.

I studied music composition at Western Washington University under Roger Briggs and Bruce Hamilton, graduating magna cum laude in both March 2013 with a Bachelor of Music in Composition and in June 2015 with Master of Music in Composition. I currently lives with my middle-school-teaching, (bass-)clarinet-playing wife and <a href="#cougarModal" data-toggle="modal">our cat</a> in Bellingham, WA, where I continue to actively compose, teach, and perform.
