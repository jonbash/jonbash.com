Without the following people, my life would certainly not be where it is today.

- My wife, Elie, who was supported me through absolutely everything, has believed in me when even I haven't, has inspired me, has loved me, has been loved by me... I can't possibly say enough about how wonderful her presence has been in my life
- My parents, who raised me to be kind, work hard, reach high, do good, and love
- Sarah & Carl, who put up with my (perhaps inevitable) brattiness as a child and today welcome me into their lives at every opportunity
- Ann, Tim, & Abel, who have been a second family to me in every single way; I cannot imagine more lovely in-laws
- Roger Briggs, who brought me in to music composition taught me the vital fundamentals of its craft, encouraged me, and has been a close friend ever since
- Bruce Hamilton, who opened countless doors of possibilities in music, gently pushed me down more interesting and fulfilling paths, and championed my music
- Lesley Sommer, who quietly glued together so many aspects of my musical life with strength, humor, and sincerity
- Christopher Bianco, who saw potential beyond my meager high school percussion skills and provided numerous platforms to me on which to flourish
- Mr. Fosket, who saw and encouraged my musical potential in subtle and not-so-subtle ways throughout my time in high school
- Tucker Peck, whose instruction and coaching has changed my life at a profoundly fundamental level
- Every other teacher, professor, and mentor who has encouraged me and believed in me
- Simon Grant, who's been a wonderful friend as I learned to navigate late college and adulthood
- The Tuggyloop gang, who has provided friendship, entertainment, and inspiration for years
- My dear Friends of Satan, who have showed me what infallible strength, friendship, and support looks like, and believed in me and in each other
- eSangha, who since welcoming me in have been a beautiful anchor in times good and bad
- More folks than I can possibly remember in the game development and game audio communities, especially in Seattle and Vancouver; I'll name all of the folks I can think of in a reasonable amount of time: Matthew M, Gordon M, Ryan I, Akash T, Em H, Maris T, Damian K, Carlye N, Andrew N, Megan C, Josie B, Shannon M, Adrien T, Luca, Tammy D, Fern, Ryro, Rachel S, Greg L, Piers, Patch... and many, many, many more that I can't recall
- Any and every other person who has been kind to me, done something helpful for me (and/or not for me), or believed in me... thank you sincerely.
