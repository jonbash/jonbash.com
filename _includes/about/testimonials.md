> I met Jon at the 2014 Global Game Jam, where he was offering his services as a composer and sound designer. I’ve worked with Jon on a few game projects since then, and wish to continue to do so for several reasons:
>
> For one, Jon has ALWAYS met his commitments to our projects. He communicates his status and any difficulties with a frequency that puts the team at ease. This is an understated quality in collaborators, which is why I feel it needs to be stated above all other testimony. This man gets stuff done.
>
> For two, Jon is extremely receptive to criticism and effectively incorporates any suggestions into his work. I am not the easiest director to work with in this sense – I have demanded very technically precise pieces that have required multiple iterations of feedback in a short timeframe. Jon has risen to those occasions and produced to my requirements without complaint.
>
> For three, Jon is good at, uh, making music. Best for last, am I right? I still loop the soundtracks for the games we’ve worked on because… well, just listen to his SoundCloud. You’ll hear what I’m talking about.

> I had the utmost pleasure of partnering up with Jon for a recent game jam. He handled the overall sound design, including composing the main theme + alternative mood variations and all sound effects.
>
> Jams are a uniquely challenging environment to work in and teaming up with strangers can often lead to difficult situations, fortunately Jon was more than able to work with the restrictions and achieved fantastic results based on very little input – I was particularly impressed by his ability to understand and produce the perfect atmosphere based on an admittedly stark game design.
> 
> Overall working with Jon was easy and the results were beyond expectations, I wouldn’t hesitate giving him full creative control over sound design on future projects and I feel his work was of vital importance to helping our game place first in the ratings.”

> Jon delivers great work, no matter the amount of direction. Jon’s compositions bring a great emotional element and depth of character to films in a subtle, yet appropriately noticeable way. His mastery of music and attention-to-detail are the tasty cake frosting every good film needs.

— Robert Speewack Bojorquez, Production Manager, Cinesaurus

> Jon Bash is the rare musical architect who can balance his cerebral inclinations with his sense for the intangible. His consistent ability to develop and deliver unique, bold, and dynamic compositions makes him an ideal working partner.
